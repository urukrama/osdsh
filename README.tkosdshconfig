Well, this script loads a file containing commands of osdsh that
change the look of it. You can then change the values and save this
changes. You can preview your changes also. This is like a
Theme-maker program, this way you can change the look of osdsh just
running a script and you can have different scripts to match your
preferences for each hour of the day or day of the week.... woohoo!!!

GPLed, so you can do almost anything to it. (don't eat it, it's toxic)
