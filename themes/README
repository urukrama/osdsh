This directory contains sample script files for osdsh and osdctl.
These scripts or themes can be run thru osdctl or piped to the fifo of osdsh.

testscript: a simple theme, using the "fixed" font. Enables everything.

biggerfonts: just as testscript, but using the "helvetica" font in a bigger
	size.

welcome: Adjust this script to a font that exists on your system.
	This is a presentation/demo of osdsh.

To try these scripts do:
	$ osdctl -S script
