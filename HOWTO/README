Keymapconfig README

What is this?

	keymapconfig is a Tcl/Tk script that generates keymaps to be loaded
into the X window sistem thru the utility called xmodmap.

	keymapconfig reads the keycode of a key and asks for a keysym t
be assigned to it. It can save the keycode-keysym pairs to a file that
can be then feed to xmodmap, and can run xmodmap itself to try the keys

	It also can load these files to edit them.

	Read the manual pages of xmodmap to understand this.


	The reason I wrote this is that I needed a tool to grab the keycodes
of the internet keys on my multimedia keyboard, this can be done with the
utility "xev" that is part of X, but I also needed to edit the keysyms and
assign them to keycodes, so after doing it manually a few times, I wrote this
program so other people can get their multimedia keys working.
I also did it as a tool for my Multimedia-X-Keyboard-HOWTO.

Installation

	Just copy it somewhere in your path. It needs Tcl/Tk.
